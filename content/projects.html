            <h1>Tech Repair and Custom Computers</h1>
            <p>
              Over the past 6 years, I have served my local community by
              advertising my general tech repair services, as well as assembling
              together fully custom computers for both gaming and office work.
              Each transaction is balanced to provide the customer with the best
              bang for their buck, as well as prioritizing the least amount of
              time spent without their device. After-sales service is also
              freely provided and encouraged to ensure the best customer
              experience I can possibly give.

            <h1>eBay and Local Controller Repair Business</h1>
            <p>
              Since September of 2024, I have turned a hobby I picked up into a
              sole-proprietary business. After repairing several video game
              controllers for myself and some friends, I realized how much waste
              is created from consumers throwing away expensive controllers due
              to common issues that could easily and cheaply be solved. In each
              controller, I install TMR Hall-Effect joysticks that use magnets
              and sensors that are physically incapable of developing
              stick-drift and dramatically increase the lifespan of the
              controller. I have 100+ successful mail-in repairs from all over
              the US and Canada through my eBay store page, and around 50+ local
              repairs from sites like Facebook Marketplace. I am currently
              partnered and in active communication with one of the lead
              manufactureres of TMR Hall-Effect joysticks, AKNES Hallpi, as well
              as very active in a global online community of hobby-ists and
              repair shops in the field.
